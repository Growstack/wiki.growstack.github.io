#Welcome to Growstack Wiki 
- the open tech stack for urban food production.

On this wiki we're co-creating documentation and guides for how to get started producing technology-enabled local food under controlled environments and hack our current food system.

We have chosen to start with vertical farming, more specifically with a modular aeroponic system (Nextfood aeroponics) that can be fitted to suit all kinds of purposes. 

On this Wiki you will soon be able to find different projects with their respective variations of the tech stack, who are all sharing their builds, technology, growing methods, grow data and knowledge in general. 

The aim is to enable a new generation of growers and decentralise food production as we know it.

Any questions?
